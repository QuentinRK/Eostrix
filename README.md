# Eostrix
Eostrix is a web app that pulls in real-time crypto prices for popular currency pairs. Every 24hrs the price change percentage for different currencies are displayed graphically on the app. 

Eostrix implements a custom class that connects to the binance API and pulls in the real-time data. With the use of flask-socketio a web socket connection is established between the client and server displaying data in real time.
